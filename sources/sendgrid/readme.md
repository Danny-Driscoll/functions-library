This is a source function template that subscribes to Sendgrid via <a href="https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook/">Sendgrid Webhooks.</a> 

To configure, create event webhooks within your Sendgrid instance and point them to the source URL found your Segment source function. 

FYI, Segment also has a native <a href="https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/sendgrid/">Sendgrid Object Source </a> integration (which pulls aggregate data from Sendgrid every 3 hours and moves to your Data Warehouse).
